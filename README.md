# Campus-Navigation-System

This a campus navigation app that finds the fastes route between buildings.

The campus is a graph. Buildings are nodes. Path are edges with weights (walking time in minutes). We use Dijkstra Algorithm, Adjacency List, Priority Queue(Min Heap) to find the shortest path, PyQt5 displays it visually.
